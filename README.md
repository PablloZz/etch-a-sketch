# Etch a Sketch Game

This project is an online version of the classic Etch a Sketch toy, built to practice DOM manipulation. Players can select the number of cells per side and draw lines on the screen. It also offers various drawing modes:

- Rainbow — Draw each cell with different colors;
- Fading — Gradually reduces the opacity of the color with each cell;
- Square — Draws squares instead of lines;
- Circle — Draws circles instead of lines;
- Initial — Toggles the mode to initial;
- Erase — Erases items one at a time;
- Clear — Erases the entire field and resets it to its initial state;
